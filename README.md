# ExchangeAppDemo
 
This is a simple Android Application which has been implemented using Clean Architecture alongside MVVM design to fetch currency exchange from web server and stored into  Linked List

This application fetches the exchange rates from the Currency Exchange API https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/fawazahmed0/currency-api@1/latest/currencies/aud.json) and stores the exchange rates in Linked List.

Bubble Sort is being used to sort the currencies in descending order based on the exchange rate, if the exchange rates are the same then sort is done based on the currency code.
